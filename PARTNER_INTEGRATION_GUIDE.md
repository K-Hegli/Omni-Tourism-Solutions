# Tourism Solutions - Partner Integration Guide

## Overview
The tourism solutions page is now cleaned up and ready for partner solution cards. Each card will function as a mini pitch deck with ROI metrics prominently displayed on the front.

## Partner Solution Card Structure

### Data Format
Each partner solution should follow this structure in the `partnerSolutions` array:

```javascript
{
  title: "Partner Solution Name",
  oneLiner: "Brief value proposition (one line)",
  description: "Detailed explanation of what this solution does for tourism operators and facilities",
  roi: {
    metrics: [
      { value: "+25%", label: "booking conversion" },
      { value: "-40%", label: "manual work" },
      { value: "€50K", label: "annual savings" }
    ],
    timeframe: "ROI within 3-6 months"
  },
  bullets: [
    "First key benefit or feature",
    "Second key benefit or feature", 
    "Third key benefit or feature"
